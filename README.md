Understanding your browser's workload is key to creating high performance sites and apps.

CSS Triggers is a site that lists every non-prefixed CSS property and the work that it creates for the browser when changed. So, for example, changing the width or height of an element triggers layout, whereas changing its background will trigger a paint.
